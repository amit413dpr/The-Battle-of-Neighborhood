    "To compare the similarities of two neighborhoods, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like Dubai. We will use K-Means clustering algorithm to perform this clustering. K- Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.  It aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
